### Flutter version used for the project: [âœ“] Flutter (Channel stable, 2.5.2, on macOS 11.6 20G165 darwin-x64, locale en-GB)

No build instructions required, just make sure you're using a similar Flutter version to avoid compatibility issues and run the project (it supports both Android and iOS)

As for my thoughts about the technical assignment, I think it went very well, the code is well organized and the UI is spot on. I've used some libraries, utility classes and architectures that I'm used to implementing in the my professional projects, so that should give you a pretty good idea of how my code style looks like and how I usually work.
